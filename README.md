My Work trying to create apps for the MYO armband.

11:36 PM : October 16th, 2014

Created a simple "Introduction" app to allow me to get the hang of the communication
This also helps me start to understand C++. (First Time).

This app will detect when the user's arm has risen as if wanting to ask a teacher a question. 
In a practical sense, this can be useful for a blind teacher and the teacher would get notified if anyone had a question during her lecture.  

TODO:
-Allow for a greater Bounds for when a hand is raised.
