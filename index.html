<p>This page is all about turning the MYO armband technology into something useful for complete control using the power of your forearm. </p>

<p>This first little project was my original attempt to take the sample hello_myo.cpp file and be able to compile the file and run it with some minor changing to the code. This got my feet wet with using Visual Studios as a means to compile and a few syntactical commands using C++. All this project does is detect when the user raises their hand to a certain height and the software will indicate when it thinks you raised your hand. I picture it being useful if their is a blind teach asking students if they have a question about the material. A shy child who doesn't like to speak up decides to raise their hand but not say a word. How will the blind teacher know he/she has a question? Little does the teacher know that this child has a MYO on their arm and when they raise their hand, a notification is sent to the blind teacher letting them know this child has an inquery. </p>
