This got my feet wet with using Visual Studios as a means to compile and a few syntactical commands using C++. All this project does is detect when the user raises their hand to a certain height and the software will indicate when it thinks you raised your hand. I picture it being useful if their is a blind teach asking students if they have a question about the material. A shy child who doesn't like to speak up decides to raise their hand but not say a word. How will the blind teacher know he/she has a question? Little does the teacher know that this child has a MYO on their arm and when they raise their hand, a notification is sent to the blind teacher letting them know this child has an inquery. \r\n\r\n```\r\n$git clone https://github.com/codyjones9879/Myo_Development.git\r\n$git checkout <your branch>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
